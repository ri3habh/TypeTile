A piano tiles inspired game to help users practice their typing skills! Users can create accounts, play 4 different game modes, check all-time leaderboards, and track their typing improvement.

Four game modes (normal, normal poison, random, random poison):
- Normal: Random sentences are generated which you type out
- Random: Generated letters are completely random
- Poison: Some letters are red, and if you click those you lose points

Users:
- Users can create accounts and login/logout
- Users can access their profile page, which tracks all of their scores and graphs them, giving them a visual indication of their improvement
- Users can see leaderboards for all four game modes, each entry links to other player's profile pages, so you can check out other users who may be better (or worse) at the game than you

Misc:
- A settings page where you can set the initial speed and font of the letters that you want (you have 5 choices)
- A nice looking home page if I do say so myself (courtesy of Alston)
